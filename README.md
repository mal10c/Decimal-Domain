# Decimal-Domain
Script that creates an alternate URL for a given domain.

This is just a simple script that determines the IPv4 address of a given domain (example: google.com) 
then converts that IPv4 address to decimal - which removes the dots.

Finally the binary value is converted to base 10.

As an example, google.com will be converted to http://2811160620
